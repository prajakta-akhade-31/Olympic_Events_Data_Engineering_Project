# Olympics Events Data Engineering Solution
Olympics Events Data Engineering Solution (Sqoop, Hive, HBase, Snowflake, Power BI)



This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for the Olympics Events Data Engineering Solution. This project involved the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from various sources into different data storage and analysis platforms. The primary technologies used in this project include Sqoop, Hive, HBase, Snowflake, and Power BI.

## Project Overview

- **Data Extraction and Transformation:** Data was extracted from multiple sources, including AWS S3, Azure Blob Container, and MySQL Server. The extracted data was then transformed to ensure consistency and quality, resulting in streamlined data processing.

- **Optimized Data Ingestion:** The project optimized data ingestion processes by leveraging tools such as Copy-Into, Snowflake Ingestion Tools, and Sqoop. These optimizations streamlined data management and analysis in Snowflake Data Warehouse, Hive, and HBase.

- **Data Analysis:** The project addressed client-specified problem statements by analyzing data. Approximately 50% of the analysis was conducted in Snowflake, 35% in Hive, and 15% in HBase. The analysis delivered actionable insights to the client.

- **ETL Orchestration:** An efficient end-to-end ETL process was orchestrated to ensure precise data loading into MySQL Server and Snowflake Data Warehouse. This optimization enabled real-time reporting and visualization in Power BI.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/src`: Contains source code for ETL processes using Sqoop, Hive, and HBase.
- `/docs`: Documentation and user guides for setting up and running the ETL processes.
- `/data`: Sample data used for testing and development.
- `/powerbi`: Power BI reports and dashboards for data visualization.
- `/sql`: SQL scripts for Snowflake and MySQL Server.
